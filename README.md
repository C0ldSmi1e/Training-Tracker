# Training Tracker

This is a simple web app that helps you track your training history and performance for Competitive Programming.

## Usage

1. Enter your Codeforces handle in Home page.
2. Generate random problems in Training page. You can also generate problems with tags.
3. View your training history in Statistics page.

## Note

1. The data are fetched from Codeforces API, so it may take a while to load.
2. The calculation of rating of generated problems and performance are from [this blog post](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/136704).
3. For now, all the data (user info, training history, etc.) are stored in your browser's local storage, so once you clear the data, you will lose all your training history.
